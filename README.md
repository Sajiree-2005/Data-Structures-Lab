# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab 🚀

This repository contains implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** programs given in my college lab.  
The programs are written in **C++** and cover fundamental concepts such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each program is stored in a separate file with proper documentation and comments for better understanding.
